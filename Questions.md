## Binary Tree | Dynamic Programming
Take a 52 card deck with 26 red and 26 black cards, in random order. Reveal cards sequentially without replacement.\
With each black card you get +1 dollar.\
With each red card you get −1 dollar.\
You can stop playing the game at any time.\
What’s the optimal stopping time, and what’s your expected profit from the optimal strategy?\
(Easier question: 6 cards – 3 red, 3 black)

## Correlation
Suppose Corr(X, Y ) = Corr(X, Z) = Corr(Y, Z) = ρ. What are the possible values of ρ?
