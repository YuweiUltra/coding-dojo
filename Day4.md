## Candy Two Pass
```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        if not ratings:
            return 0
        
        ret, up, down, peak = 1, 0, 0, 0
        
        for prev, curr in zip(ratings[:-1], ratings[1:]):
            if prev < curr:
                up, down, peak = up + 1, 0, up + 1
                ret += 1 + up
            elif prev == curr:
                up = down = peak = 0
                ret += 1
            else:
                up, down = 0, down + 1
                ret += 1 + down - int(peak >= down)
        
        return ret
```

                up, down, peak = up + 1, 0, up + 1
                ret += 1 + up
            elif prev == curr:
                up = down = peak = 0
                ret += 1
            else:
                up, down = 0, down + 1
                ret += 1 + down - int(peak >= down)
